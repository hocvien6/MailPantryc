I am interested in Postfix and currently trying to write my own simple milter for Postfix, but I have a problem
Everthing is ok when testing:
$ telnet localhost 25
mail from: sender@localhost
rcpt to: recipient@localhost
data
from: apple@store.com
to: microsoft@google.com
subject: Hi there
an apple a day, keep doctor away
.
quit

("sender" and "recipient" are user in my linux system)
And here is last output from /var/mail/recipient

From sender@localhost  Fri Jul 18 11:08:46 2014
Return-Path: <sender@localhost>
X-Original-To: recipient@localhost
Delivered-To: recipient@localhost

I have already installed Postfix 2.9.6, libmilter and had a stand-alone "sample.c" file, copied from
https://www.milter.org/developers/sample

To compile on Ubuntu 12.04, I used:
$ gcc -L/usr/lib/libmilter -o sample sample.c -lmilter -lpthread

I followed guide at:
https://www.milter.org/developers/installation
http://www.postfix.org/MILTER_README.html
But I don't know how to plug it into Postfix, when I have only "sample" binary executable file in hands

Did I forget any configuration options at main.cf and master.cf such as "smtpd_milters" etc.?
Please help me, what should I do?
I am newbie and... sorry for my bad english ^^...
